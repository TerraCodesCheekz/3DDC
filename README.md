3DDC will be a Proof of Concept dreamcast emulator. The current goal is to get Sonic Adventure 1 working somewhat decently, though expect 2d games to work better first. 

For now all I know is that Dynarec will be an absolute piece of crap to implement, but I know that the n3ds could probably handle at least something dreamcast related running that isn't a port. Contrary to the name 3D support probably won't be a thing and 3dsDC is more to the point but oh well.
